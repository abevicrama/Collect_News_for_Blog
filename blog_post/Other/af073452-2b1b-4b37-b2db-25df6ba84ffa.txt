Nigerians send message to Trump after US airstrikes, sparking debate on digital activism 

In the world of digital activism, the intersection of technology and politics is crucial. When governments or leaders take drastic measures, citizens often turn to social media platforms for feedback and mobilization. This can be particularly significant in countries like Nigeria, where access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) plays a vital role in shaping public opinion.

The US airstrikes on terrorist targets in Syria and Iraq have sent shockwaves through the global community, prompting widespread criticism from civil society groups. Nigerians have taken to social media platforms to express their outrage and demand action against the targeted individuals or groups. By engaging with these online discussions, citizens can contribute to the democratic process and hold those in power accountable.
