LG has announced its latest innovation in gaming monitors - the UltraGear evo series. This series boasts cutting-edge AI-powered upscaling technology that will revolutionize your gaming experience.

The AI-based upscaling feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and enhance the resolution of low-quality content, such as video games and movies, before displaying it on your monitor. This results in sharper, more detailed visuals, making for a more immersive and engaging gaming experience.

But what really sets these monitors apart is their 1ms response time, which reduces input lag and ensures that you're always in control of the action. Additionally, LG has incorporated its signature Nanocell panel technology for reduced eye strain and improved color accuracy. With features like NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync, you can also enjoy a smooth gaming experience with minimal screen tearing or interpolation artifacts.

Upgrade your gaming setup today and discover a new level of performance and immersion - the UltraGear evo series is now available at select retailers.
