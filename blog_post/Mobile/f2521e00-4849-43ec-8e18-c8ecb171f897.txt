In a shocking turn of events, the NYPD has been sued by the company behind a popular social engineering platform designed for spurring romance scams. The Ultra-Realistic AI Face Swapping Platform is capable of creating nearly perfect face swaps during live video chats, making it an attractive tool for scammers looking to build trust with potential victims.

The platform's popularity has led to concerns that the NYPD may have inadvertently collected sensitive data through its use by hackers. A recent investigation into a group of Telegram users who used the app revealed that they had been using the system to target vulnerable individuals and steal their money.

However, in a surprising twist, this was not the only instance where the platform came under scrutiny. According to reports, Haotian's main channel on Telegram vanished after an independent investigation found that scammers were using the platform to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about users. The incident has sparked questions about data protection and user privacy.
