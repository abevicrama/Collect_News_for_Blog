An air fryer is not just a cooking method, it's a game-changer. The technology behind these devices is based on rapid air circulation and precise temperature control, allowing for perfectly cooked food with minimal oil. However, this power comes with risks - certain foods are more hazardous to consume in an air fryer than others.

When baking in an air fryer, use recipes specifically designed for an air fryer and avoid assuming that an oven recipe will translate. This means skipping over popcorn, which can explode into a fire hazard due to its high heat and rapid evaporation of flammable compounds.

By understanding the technical limitations of your air fryer, you can unlock a world of delicious and safe cooking options. Take it one step further by investing in a thermometer, silicone mats, or other specialized equipment to elevate your air fryer game. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, learning how to use this versatile kitchen appliance safely and effectively is an essential skill for any home cook.

The Moylan arrow, named after its creator James Moylan, is an ingenious indicator of which side of the fuel filler is located in your car's gauge cluster. Introduced in 1986, this simple yet effective solution was thought up by Ford employee James Moylan to address a common problem with older cars where fuel fillers were often at the rear end.

Now, most modern cars come equipped with the Moylan arrow or some form of indicator for the same purpose. But what sets them apart is their placement - it's not just about visibility; it's also crucial for owners like us Jalops who frequently swap between different vehicles.

In our current plug-in-hybrid Mercedes-AMG S63, we have separate sections for fuel level and charge level, with an arrow pointing to the right (left for the driver). This means that if you're driving one car and switching to another while still in transit or parked, you'll never be caught off guard again.

The innovative design allows for users to fold the phone into multiple configurations, providing a seamless experience regardless of how you hold it. Google promises 10-plus years of folding for its latest Fold and has finally earned an IP68 rating for its folding design. Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7 is one of the best folding phones of the year, thanks to its massive reduction in size and weight over previous models. This results in a phone that's significantly thinner than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. However, Apple's drastic improvement in battery capacities on the iPhone 17 Pro models this year may outweigh some users' desire for portability.

Despite these advancements, silicon-carbon batteries mean both phones are still relatively heavy. The adaptability of these batteries also means they can drain quickly when used extensively. In contrast to other flagship devices on the market, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is not only heavier but also less battery-efficient due to its massive size and power-hungry processors.

If you're in the market for a new phone and want to consider a folding device, there are several options available that cater to different needs.

The Hall effect upgrades in the official Xbox controller do bring some cosmetic changes, making it an interesting alternative for those looking for a more premium feel. However, these changes are largely superficial. For users who want an Xbox controller that looks and feels like a PS5 pad, The Competitor Controller does the job.

Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just starting to explore new controllers, this review highlights some key technical details: the cable-free design, USB-A to USB-C compatibility, and Hall effect upgrades over the official controller. By reading on, you'll gain insight into what makes The Competitor Controller an attractive option for those seeking a premium gaming experience without the hefty price tag.

Cryptocurrencies have been making waves in the financial world for years, but it seems like a sudden shift is underway. The likes of memecoin fever have temporarily replaced stability as the top cryptocurrency's market capitalization has plummeted. However, this volatility may be about to give way to something much more stable - namely, stablecoins.

The rise of AI and machine learning in industries such as finance means that digital assets are becoming increasingly integrated into traditional systems. This shift is expected to lead to a boost in the use of blockchain technology, which has proven itself time and again to be highly resilient to price volatility.

With the increasing adoption of AI in various sectors comes the need for more robust security features. Stablecoins, being pegged to traditional currencies, offer an attractive solution to this problem. By using blockchain technology, stablecoins can provide a level of protection against price fluctuations that makes them a more secure option than traditional cryptocurrencies.

This trend is expected to continue in the coming months as investors become increasingly aware of the benefits of investing in stablecoins. With growing demand for security features and the increasing integration of AI into various industries, it seems like we're on the cusp of a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market.

Google's efforts to expand its data center operations in countries with abundant renewable energy like Indonesia are a double-edged sword. The company's decision to reopen Iowa's shuttered nuclear power plant is just one example of how international clean energy investments can have far-reaching consequences.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with an estimated 70% ice mass loss over the past century, holds enough water to raise global sea levels by 5 meters. As carbon removal technologies continue to advance, we're starting to see tangible results in the form of innovative projects like Running Tide, which aims to sequester one billion tons of CO2 through ocean fertilization.

Yet, concerns about AI data centers' water use have only intensified. A recent study found that up to 40% of the world's global freshwater consumption is used for cooling large-scale computing systems. This raises critical questions about the environmental and social impacts of these operations on vulnerable communities like those in Africa and Asia.

As we look to the future, it's essential that we consider the broader implications of our technological advancements.

Repair advocates are continuing their push into 2026 and beyond, applying pressure on legislators to give gearheads the options they want when it comes to repairing gadgets every day. This fight is not just about access to tools, but about the fundamental principles of technological progress - that technology should be designed with repairability in mind from the start.

Google's redesign of its Pixel Watch to make it more repairable after pressure from repair advocates is a significant victory for those fighting against restrictive regulations and obfuscated repair manuals. Despite these successes, companies continue to find ways to evade regulations and limit access to repair tools - a trend that has become increasingly common in the tech industry.

Repair advocates are pushing back by re-examining Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and exploring new avenues for bypassing passwords and encryption. Allowing bypasses, like those that enable device unlocking or unlocking access to encrypted apps, could give consumers more control over their devices. With many manufacturers relying on proprietary lock mechanisms, companies may find it difficult to comply with changing consumer demands.

Repair advocates urge lawmakers to repeal Section 1201, citing the importance of giving consumers a say in how they use and interact with technology. As we move forward into an era where technology is increasingly embedded in our daily lives, the need for repairability has never been more pressing. By joining forces and advocating for policy changes, we can push for a future where devices are designed to be repaired, not just discarded.",Mobile,['Boone Ashworth'],https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-right-to-repair/,2025-12-25 06:00:00-05:00,True,True

For most consumers, deciding on which one to choose will ultimately come down to whether you need the extra power or features that come with the higher-end model. However, it's worth noting that the chip used in both models is identical, so you won't see significant differences in performance.

Despite this, there are some key differences to consider. The Series 11 can offer up to 24 hours of battery life in low-power mode, while the SE tops out at just 18 hours. Additionally, each model features sleep tracking, which includes notifications and a Sleep score that provides an accurate assessment of how well you slept.

With so many great options on the market, it's natural to feel overwhelmed when deciding between these two models. Here are some tips to help you make your decision:

Consider your needs: Think about what features are most important to you. If sleep tracking is a top priority, the Series 11 might be the better choice.
Weigh the price tag: While both models offer impressive battery life and feature sets, the higher-end model will undoubtedly cost more.

These large-scale exercises involve mobilizing army, navy, air units and rocket forces, restricting operations for 10 hours from 8:30 am local time. The aim is to test combat readiness and send a clear message against secessionist movements.

The exercise comes amid significant Chinese military modernization since then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in September, which marked increased support for the island nation. These drills mark China's efforts to encircle Taiwan, restrict its airspace and sea routes, and demonstrate its capabilities in case of potential conflict.

This is not just a test run - it's a clear warning to Taiwanese independence separatist forces and external interference. We urge all nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Taiwan.

The next phase of China's military modernization involves the development of more advanced anti-surface warfare systems, as well as increased deployment of hypersonic missiles in the region.

Video ads are a common way to monetize content online, but their performance can be affected by technical issues.

Technical considerations include poor server load times, inadequate buffering algorithms, and insufficient bandwidth. These factors can lead to the slow loading of video content, making it difficult for users to engage with ads.

This is made possible by Google's gradual rollout of a feature that allows users to switch from one email address to another, including their current Gmail address.

This change will enable you to easily move your old Gmail account to a new one, and sign into other Google services using either the new or old address. However, it's worth noting that this change won't be complete for 12 months - during that time, you'll only be able to use an additional email address tied to your account.

If you're due for a Gmail makeover, make sure to check out the official support website for more information on how to switch addresses.

When I first created my Gmail account back in the day, I was shocked by how quickly my inbox filled up with messages. As time went on, I realized that transferring my existing messages to a new Gmail account wasn't feasible due to school or business commitments.

The technical importance of this process lies in the fact that Google's free 15GB storage limit can fill up quickly, and deleting certain files or settings would actually reduce your available space.

To get started, make sure you have a basic understanding of Google's data retention policies and Gmail's security measures. Before transferring your messages, take note of the following tips:

* Be cautious when using third-party services like Gmail forwarding or bulk email management tools that can consume excess storage.
* Set up a new app password to create an additional layer of security for transferring sensitive data.
* Transfer all your emails from the old account before deleting them - this will ensure you're not accidentally losing important messages.

A video player was slow to load content, and the audio on ads was too loud. Other problems included ad freezing or delaying, and the page getting stuck while loading ads. This could be due to multiple videos running at once, which increases processing time, or a faulty internet connection.

Some of these issues are related to JavaScript libraries like Adobe Flash, which have been deprecated for years but still used in some cases. Additionally, the video player used by the country's state-owned broadcaster was not optimized for modern browsers, resulting in slower load times and poor performance. However, Microsoft has made efforts to improve internet connectivity in Myanmar, and there are also reports of users taking matters into their own hands by using VPNs or bypassing ads altogether.
