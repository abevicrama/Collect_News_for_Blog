We Ain't Seen Nothing Yet—Trump's Mass Deportations Will Only Grow From Here

The Trump administration's push for mass deportations of immigrants in the US is gaining momentum, with many experts warning that it will only continue to escalate. The idea that migrants should self-deport may have seemed like a radical proposal at first, but now it seems increasingly difficult to implement.

As tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon continue to invest in border security technologies, there's a growing recognition that these systems must be aligned with humanitarian principles. But what does this mean for migrants, and how can we ensure their safety?
