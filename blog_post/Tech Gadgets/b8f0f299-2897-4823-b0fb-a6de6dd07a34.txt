In the era of digital trade, the tit-for-tat game of tariffs has been played out on vast scales. But what happens when the leader of America's former trading partners takes an aggressive stance? In 2026, they'll need to grapple with the consequences of retaliatory measures that could cripple their economies.

These tariffs don't just harm American companies; they also create a ripple effect through global supply chains. The digital locks used by US tech giants and large US-based companies are designed to extract enormous rents from these interactions. According to a recent study, the annual losses can run into hundreds of billions of dollars.

The good news is that there's a better way to respond to tariffs. Research suggests that countries like China, which has already implemented digital locks similar to those used by tech giants, may take a more nuanced approach in 2026. It's time for global leaders to rethink their trade strategies and consider alternatives to tariffs.
