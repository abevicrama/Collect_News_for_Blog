"Why WeTransfer co-founder is building another file transfer service"

WeTransfer, a popular file sharing service founded by Nalden van de Wijdevelt in 2009 along with Rinke Visser and Bas Beerens, has undergone significant changes since its acquisition by Bending Spoon last year. The decision to overhaul the service's direction raised eyebrows among fans of the original WeTransfer experience. A key factor contributing to this change was a confusing move related to transfer link experiences. Moreover, the company made a puzzling decision to lay off 75% of its staff. After taking time to regroup and reassess the situation, co-founder Nalden is now pushing forward with an alternative file transfer service that prioritizes simplicity and user experience. With plans to expand its storage capacity and file upload limits, this new service promises to be a breath of fresh air for users seeking reliable online file sharing solutions.
