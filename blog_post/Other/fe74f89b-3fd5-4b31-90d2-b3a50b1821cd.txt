**The Fed admits it can’t fix an economic problem it helped create**

As interest rates plummeted in 2020 to support an economy battered by the pandemic, many were convinced the Federal Reserve could alleviate specific labor market issues. However, as the years have passed, officials have come to a surprising realization: they simply can't. The Fed has kept benchmark lending rates near zero for over two years, and it's not just about boosting or easing pressure off the labor market - it's also about preventing further inflation. This shift in strategy underscores the complexities of monetary policy, where even seemingly unrelated factors like interest rates, inflation, and employment levels interact in intricate ways. To get a deeper understanding of this dynamic, consider exploring advanced economic models that simulate real-world market scenarios to better grasp how interest rate adjustments impact the labor market.
