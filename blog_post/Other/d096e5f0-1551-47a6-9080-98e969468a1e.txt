China's military has announced major drills around Taiwan in response to growing tensions over independence.

These large-scale exercises involve mobilizing army, navy, air units and rocket forces, restricting operations for 10 hours from 8:30 am local time. The aim is to test combat readiness and send a clear message against secessionist movements.

The exercise comes amid significant Chinese military modernization since then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in September, which marked increased support for the island nation. These drills mark China's efforts to encircle Taiwan, restrict its airspace and sea routes, and demonstrate its capabilities in case of potential conflict.

This is not just a test run - it's a clear warning to Taiwanese independence separatist forces and external interference. We urge all nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Taiwan.

The next phase of China's military modernization involves the development of more advanced anti-surface warfare systems, as well as increased deployment of hypersonic missiles in the region. A recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) suggests that China has spent over $100 billion on military modernization since 2017.

We must stay informed about these developments and their implications for global security and international relations. Follow us for updates and analysis on this complex issue.
