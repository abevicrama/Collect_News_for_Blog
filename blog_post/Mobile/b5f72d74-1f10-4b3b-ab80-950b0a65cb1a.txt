Next came Motorola, which has seen a lot of success in recent years with its Razr folding flip phones. The innovative design allows for users to fold the phone into multiple configurations, providing a seamless experience regardless of how you hold it. Google promises 10-plus years of folding for its latest Fold and has finally earned an IP68 rating for its folding design. Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7 is one of the best folding phones of the year, thanks to its massive reduction in size and weight over previous models. This results in a phone that's significantly thinner than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. However, Apple's drastic improvement in battery capacities on the iPhone 17 Pro models this year may outweigh some users' desire for portability.

Despite these advancements, silicon-carbon batteries mean both phones are still relatively heavy. The adaptability of these batteries also means they can drain quickly when used extensively. In contrast to other flagship devices on the market, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is not only heavier but also less battery-efficient due to its massive size and power-hungry processors.

If you're in the market for a new phone and want to consider a folding device, there are several options available that cater to different needs. However, it's essential to weigh your priorities before making a decision. With so many great options out there, take some time to research and compare the features of various devices before making an informed choice.
