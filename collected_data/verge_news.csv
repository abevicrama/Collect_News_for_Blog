The announcement compares the proposed warning labels to those that have been added to products such as tobacco, alcohol, and media with flashing lights.
Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that social media platforms should add warning labels.
“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.
Last year, New York passed laws requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.",2025-12-27 00:00:00,['Anthony Ha'],1766927075.8463597

https://www.theverge.com/games/846828/ps5-best-games-2025,The best PS5 games from 2025,"driven by Sony and mostly Microsoft bringing their exclusives to other platforms, it’s getting harder to highlight games that make a singular console shine.
Indeed, the top-performing games year after year on both PlayStation and Xbox are multiplatform releases, and often the best games of the year, like 2025 GOTY winner Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, similarly launch on most everything.
For Microsoft, it’s Game Pass; for Sony in 2025, it’s the PlayStation Portal.
For $200, roughly half the price of a PS5, you essentially get a second one, able to play select games without the need to stream them from the console.
The sequel is still plenty weird, but because it builds off of the previous game, it’s also much easier to understand from the get-go.",2025-12-28 13:00:00+00:00,['Ash Parrish'],1766930507.672347

But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product.
Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being the future, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success.
And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.

(This was less of a problem with older cars, where the fuel filler was often at the rear end, sometimes behind the license plate.)
Now, of course, you'd be hard-pressed to find a car that doesn't have the Moylan arrow, or at least some indicator of which side the fuel filler is on.
I'm currently driving a plug-in-hybrid Mercedes-AMG S63, and the gauge cluster has separate sections for both fuel level and charge level, with an arrow showing which side each filler is on.
For people like us Jalops that are always jumping in and out of different cars, the Moylan arrow really makes a difference.",2025-12-26 20:00:03+00:00,['Daniel Golson'],1766950143.7076645,False
