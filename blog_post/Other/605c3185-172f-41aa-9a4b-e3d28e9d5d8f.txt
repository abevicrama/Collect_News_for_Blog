Researchers are baffled by dozens of dead birds found on Tappahannock bridge in Virginia, prompting an investigation into the incident. The phenomenon raises concerns about bird migration patterns and the potential for avian flu or other diseases. Wildlife experts emphasize that handling or picking up sick or dead wild birds can transmit these illnesses to humans, especially those with weakened immune systems. To mitigate this risk, officials are urging residents to avoid contact with the birds and report any sightings to state wildlife officials. Birdwatchers on social media have expressed concern for the well-being of the affected birds. The investigation is ongoing, but experts point out that handling dead animals can also pose health risks to humans.
