You're about to discover a little-known feature that can save you from frustration and confusion on the road.

The Moylan arrow, named after its creator James Moylan, is an ingenious indicator of which side of the fuel filler is located in your car's gauge cluster. Introduced in 1986, this simple yet effective solution was thought up by Ford employee James Moylan to address a common problem with older cars where fuel fillers were often at the rear end.

Now, most modern cars come equipped with the Moylan arrow or some form of indicator for the same purpose. But what sets them apart is their placement - it's not just about visibility; it's also crucial for owners like us Jalops who frequently swap between different vehicles.

In our current plug-in-hybrid Mercedes-AMG S63, we have separate sections for fuel level and charge level, with an arrow pointing to the right (left for the driver). This means that if you're driving one car and switching to another while still in transit or parked, you'll never be caught off guard again.

To get your Moylan arrow up and running on your vehicle of choice, head over to your car's service manual or manufacturer's website for more information.
