A 5-year-old mystery has been solved when Flagstaff man Arron Stump was reunited with his stolen dog Olive.

The technology behind the miracle is clear: microchips, which contain the owner's contact information and unique identification number, are embedded in dogs. These chips can be scanned to identify a specific dog, making it possible for authorities to locate an animal that has been lost or stolen.

Stump got Olive in 2017 and took her to work with him daily. Over time, he had to rely on his phone's Bluetooth technology to communicate with the GPS-enabled microchip embedded in her collar.

But now, thanks to a clever email notification from Babbitt Ranch, Stump can finally see Olive again.

As tech-savvy dog owners know, tracking your pet's location is just a few steps away using GPS and Wi-Fi. However, Stump was able to use the Bluetooth connection between his phone and the microchip on Olive's collar to track her down.

Stump is thrilled to be reunited with Olive after five long years, and he credits the technology behind it for bringing them back together.

So why not check your pet's microchip today? It could just save you a 5-year reunion like Stump's.
