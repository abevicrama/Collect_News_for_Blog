This Xbox controller is hardly Hyperkin's first somewhat tongue-in-cheek offering, as evidenced by their recent release of The Competitor Controller. This isn't just another wired-only controller, but rather a cable-free option connecting to your Xbox console or PC via a 3-meter USB-A to USB-C cable.

The Hall effect upgrades in the official Xbox controller do bring some cosmetic changes, making it an interesting alternative for those looking for a more premium feel. However, these changes are largely superficial. For users who want an Xbox controller that looks and feels like a PS5 pad, The Competitor Controller does the job.

Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just starting to explore new controllers, this review highlights some key technical details: the cable-free design, USB-A to USB-C compatibility, and Hall effect upgrades over the official controller. By reading on, you'll gain insight into what makes The Competitor Controller an attractive option for those seeking a premium gaming experience without the hefty price tag.
