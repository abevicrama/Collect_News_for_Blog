The battle between Naomi Osaka and Ashleigh Barty was billed as entertainment but critics warned that it risked reducing women's tennis to a sideshow and trivializing its progress toward equality, pitting four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka against 2020 US Open finalist Kyrgios.

The technical importance of this match lay in the high level of skill required from both players. Both were capable of delivering precise and powerful groundstrokes, while also possessing excellent movement off the ball. 

The Australian ace's decision to use drop shots was particularly noteworthy, as it highlighted his ability to adapt to different opponents and situations.

"I don't think many people would have put their hand up to be in this position," Kyrgios said with a hint of humility.
"It was a really tough match," Osaka added.
"I made a lot of great shots, moved a lot to the net … great drop shots, Nick, great serving. 
The outcome was far from certain as both players gave it their all, showcasing their incredible athleticism and mental toughness.
