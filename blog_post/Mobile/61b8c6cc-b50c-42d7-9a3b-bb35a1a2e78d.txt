A popular pet-sitting platform has turned into a crisis of epic proportions after two dogs died under suspicious circumstances. The situation started when a dog sitter from Rover, one of the most trusted services in the city, was hired by a local family to care for their pet Aku. Tragically, Aku succumbed to dehydration and the incident is still shrouded in mystery.

Technical details that make this story worth noting include the fact that all interactions with the dog sitter were conducted through Rover's platform, which allows users to rate their experiences and leave reviews. This could potentially be a key piece of evidence for investigators looking into the matter. Moreover, the use of facial recognition technology on social media platforms like Facebook has raised concerns about potential misuse.
