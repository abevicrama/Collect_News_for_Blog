Sauron, the high-end home security startup for "super premium" customers, plucks a new CEO out of Sonos.

Market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. Research showed that companies like Nest and August often struggle to scale and maintain their tech-driven solutions. The company's AI-powered deterrence system is vague at best, failing to address complex user behaviors. Bouvat-Merlin's experience as chief product officer at Sonos has given him a unique understanding of what premium customers want in home security.

Sauron's mission aligns with the growing demand for high-end home security solutions. The company aims to solve real customer problems, addressing market gaps and providing innovative features that set it apart from competitors.
