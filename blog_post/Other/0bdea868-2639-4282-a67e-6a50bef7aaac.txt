This arrest is a prime example of how law enforcement can leverage technology to make arrests even when they're in desperate need of help - or as in this case, desperately needed by their own family members.

The technical aspect of this crime is quite fascinating. The 911 call provided critical information about the suspect's location and intentions, allowing police to track him down quickly. This type of real-time communication and data analysis has become increasingly important in law enforcement, with many agencies using tools like Nextel and SMS to receive emergency calls.

Police also use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to disseminate information and engage with the public in a timely manner. In this case, the police department's Twitter handle, @LASVegasPD, was used to share updates about the arrest.

By harnessing technology like these, law enforcement agencies can improve their response times, reduce the risk of innocent people getting caught in the crossfire, and bring justice to victims' families - often faster than ever before.
