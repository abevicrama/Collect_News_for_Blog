I'm an Air Fryer Power User. Here Are 10 Foods I'll Never Put Inside It Again.

An air fryer is not just a cooking method, it's a game-changer. The technology behind these devices is based on rapid air circulation and precise temperature control, allowing for perfectly cooked food with minimal oil. However, this power comes with risks - certain foods are more hazardous to consume in an air fryer than others.

When baking in an air fryer, use recipes specifically designed for an air fryer and avoid assuming that an oven recipe will translate. This means skipping over popcorn, which can explode into a fire hazard due to its high heat and rapid evaporation of flammable compounds.

By understanding the technical limitations of your air fryer, you can unlock a world of delicious and safe cooking options. Take it one step further by investing in a thermometer, silicone mats, or other specialized equipment to elevate your air fryer game. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, learning how to use this versatile kitchen appliance safely and effectively is an essential skill for any home cook.
