You can download Andromeda OS, the cancelled Windows for Surface Duo.

Technical importance of Android-based OS:
The original plans were to create an Android-based operating system for the Surface Duo, which suggests that it was designed with mobile device-centric features in mind. This would have likely included features like split-screen multitasking and a stylus support.

Unstable build:
The unstable build is available because Microsoft ended up choosing to go with an Android-based OS instead of Windows 10. This might be due to the fact that the Duo's design wasn't well-suited for a full-fledged Windows operating system, or it could be related to the development process itself.
