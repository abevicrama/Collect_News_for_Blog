Millions under winter weather alerts on busy post-holiday travel day - At least 2 million people are under blizzard warnings in the Midwest, where winds could gust from 40 to 60 mph, and New England will see rain and freezing rain late Sunday into Monday. This is due to a potent storm system that will bring heavy snowfall and strong winds across the region. The National Weather Service office in Des Moines, Iowa, "discouraged" those traveling Sunday into Monday.

Blowing snow will lead to whiteout conditions over northern Iowa Sunday and Sunday night, making travel extremely hazardous. To stay informed about this winter weather alert, follow your local news and check reliable sources for updates on road conditions and travel advisories.
