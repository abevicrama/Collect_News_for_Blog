James Moylan, the engineer behind Ford's advanced arrow signaling system, which enables vehicles to indicate their intended fueling location, has passed away. This technology is crucial in ensuring passenger safety and facilitating efficient fuel distribution during long road trips.

As part of Toyota's effort to expand its offerings in Japan and strengthen trade relations with the U.S., they are now exporting made-in-U.S.A. vehicles to Japan, including those equipped with Moylan's arrow signaling system. This innovation not only improves efficiency but also enhances the overall driving experience for Japanese customers.

Toyota has stated that the export of these vehicles is part of a broader initiative to promote mutual understanding and cooperation between the U.S. and Japanese automotive industries. As consumers increasingly prioritize fuel efficiency, vehicle safety, and connectivity features, Moylan's work will play an essential role in shaping the future of the industry.
