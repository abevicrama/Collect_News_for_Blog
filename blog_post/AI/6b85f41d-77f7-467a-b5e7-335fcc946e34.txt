People Are Using Sora 2 to Make Disturbing Videos With AI-Generated Kids

OpenAI is launching its GPT-5.2 model as it navigates the 'code red' of competing with Google and other AI competitors. This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of conversational AI, which has long promised to connect people with pals far and wide. However, twenty years on, social media still relies heavily on AI-generated content for kinship. The development of chatbots like Sora 2 is now being hindered by the increasing sophistication of its competitors.

As we see in China where scammers are using AI-generated images to deceive users into giving them refunds from dead crabs and shredded bed sheets, the lines between authenticity and fabricated content have become increasingly blurred. But with OpenAI's GPT-5.2 model, the stakes have never been higher. The company must continue to innovate if it hopes to remain a leader in this rapidly evolving field.

Take advantage of this opportunity by signing up for an account on GPT-5.2 and start creating your own AI-generated content today! But be warned: once you dip your toes into the world of chatbots, there's no turning back.
