For over a month, Velazquez spent 24 hours a day in a room with 60 other women, raising concerns about her mental health and the well-being of others at the detention center she was held at in Georgia. 

Her experience highlights the need for immigration reform and increased support for detained individuals. The use of video conferencing technology is becoming increasingly important for remote work and online interactions.

To help combat issues like this, it's crucial to prioritize digital literacy and education. Many people, including those involved in detention centers, lack access to reliable internet and digital resources. By providing accessible tech tools and training programs, we can promote better communication and understanding between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.

By supporting initiatives that bridge the gap between technology and social services, we can work towards a more just and equitable society.
